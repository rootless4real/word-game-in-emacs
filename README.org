For the uninitiated, this is a process of elimination word game.
You guess a word and each letter of your word will be color coded to reveal how it relates to the hidden word.

** FAQ
*** How do I add more word lists?
Word lists are plain text files added under =wordel-words-dir=.
There should be only one word per line.
